Spaceship Titanic is a binary classification dataset for predicting whether passenger was transported during the collision.


For building the prediction model, the steps is following:
1. Explore the data to gain insights
2. Feature engineering based on the insights
3. Impute missing values
4. Preprocessing
5. Training Machine Learning methods
6. Make the predicition
